        "questionText": "A small coastal town experiences a sudden increase in jellyfish sightings near its popular beaches. Local marine biologists report no significant changes in water temperature or acidity. The town recently upgraded its sewage treatment plant and banned certain sunscreens to protect coral reefs. Tourism has increased by 10% compared to last year, with more visitors from neighboring countries. A new fishing regulation limits catches of certain species. Curiously, sales of ice cream and bottled water have spiked, while sales of inflatable pool toys have decreased. The town's annual sandcastle competition was canceled due to lack of funding.",

With limited resources and no immediate help from the mainland, the islanders must find a way to continue education for their children. The island has abundant natural resources but lacks modern technology. The community values education highly but also needs to maintain essential services like fishing and farming. How can they ensure continuous learning for all students while dealing with their limited resources and isolation?",

This means that if you give yourself a week to complete a two-hour task, the task will take up the whole week because you'll stretch it out or procrastinate. On the other hand, if you give yourself a tighter deadline, you're more likely to complete the task efficiently. The idea encourages setting shorter deadlines to increase productivity and avoid wasting time.",
